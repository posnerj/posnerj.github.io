Jonas is a dedicated computer scientist specializing in High Performance Computing.
He received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Kassel, Germany, where he also earned his Ph.D. in 2022.
Currently, he is working on his habilitation as a postdoctoral researcher at the same university.

Jonas' research interests include load balancing, fault tolerance, and resource adaptivity for Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems.
More recently, he has focused on resource adaptivity in general to optimize the efficient use of supercomputing resources.
His work covers a broad spectrum, including the development of advanced job scheduling algorithms, the improvement of application programming using AMT systems, and the interaction between resource managers and jobs.
