Jonas Posner is a dedicated computer scientist specializing in High-Performance Computing (HPC).
Since 2025, Jonas serves as **Professor** of _Operating Systems and Parallel Processing_ at Fulda University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
He received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Kassel, Germany, where he also earned his Ph.D. in 2022.
Afterward, he worked as a postdoctoraKl researcher and served as a substitute chair for the Software Engineering research group for one semester at the same university.

Jonas' research interests include load balancing, fault tolerance, and resource adaptivity for Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems.
More recently, his work has focused on resource adaptivity more broadly, aiming to optimize the efficient use of supercomputing resources.
His research spans a wide range of topics, including the development of advanced job-scheduling algorithms, improving programmability and performance of AMT systems, and studying the interaction between resource managers and applications.
