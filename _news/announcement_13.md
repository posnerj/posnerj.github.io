Yesterday, I had the pleasure of delivering a presentation at the _[CARLA conference](https://carlaconference.org)_ in Kingston, Jamaica, on our latest paper, **Evaluating Malleable Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters Using Real-World Workloads**.

The slides are now available online at: _[10.5281/zenodo.17202606](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17202606)_
